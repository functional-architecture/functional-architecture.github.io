              "Functional Software Architecture" refers to methods of construction
              and structure of large and long-lived software projects that are
              implemented in functional languages and released to real users,
              typically in industry.

              <h3>Simplicity</h3>

              <p>
                Software design is fundamentally a human endeavour. Simple systems
                allow for more reasoning bandwith between the software and its
                designer.
              </p>

              <p>
                Problem domains are complex enough. The solutions we build should be
                as simple as possible.
